## Overview
This repository contains reproducible codes for the proposed MindID model.
Taking the advantages of EEG-based techniques for attack-resilient, we propose a biometric EEG-based identification approach, to overcome the limitations of traditional biometric identification methods. We analyzed the EEG data pattern characteristics and capture the Delta pattern which takes the most distinguishable features for user identification. Based on the pattern decomposition analysis, we report the structure of the proposed approach. In the first step of identification, the preprocessed EEG data is decomposed into Delta pattern. Then an attention-based RNN structure is employed to extract deep representations of Delta wave. At last, the deep representations are used to directly identify the userâ€™ ID. Please check our paper for more details on the algorithm.
